# shave-the-yak

## Description
What is yak shaving? The act of completing a seemingly small task that has no obvious relationship to your intended task, but which is actually linked to that main aim through a chain of other activities.

This project represents the entire collective effort and accumulation of completed _small_ tasks that, at the time, didn't always appear to be directly useful, but have collaboratively come together to amount to a plethora of knowledge in computer programming. The application itself is a quiz that touches on the variety of topics covered throughout an extensive six-month coding bootcamp.

## Motivation
While using the knowledge we've learned to create the application itself, we wanted to make a coding quiz that would also test various aspects of that knowledge as a final farewell and recap to the bootcamp.

###### Disclaimer: No yaks were actually shaved in the making of this project. That would be a waste of time...or would it?
